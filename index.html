        <h2>ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Hey, I'm Lynden. I am 21 years old, and fresh out of Clarkson University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am an avid coder and designer, and exercise my skills by making programs and websites like this one, which does serve as an easel to show off some of my proudest achievements so far, but was also just a fun experimental project on its own.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time, I like to model in programs like Blender and Maya. I'm not super experienced in it just yet, but I am proud to have been able to produce every model displayed on this website! I enjoy audio engineering and songwriting, and at some point, I would like to release some music of my own in the future. Additionally, I'm always looking for new ways and techniques to better improve my programs and websites. In fact, this is my first site using ThreeJS! 
        </p>

        <p>
          Moving forward, I would love to exercise my skills to improve the vast and complex world of technology. Whether this means improving on current systems with advanced new techniques, or creating brand-new, out-of-the-box solutions altogether, I am eager to solve our problems. As time passes, I would also like to complete and release my own video games. It's a lofty goal, but I am determined to share my creativity with the world.
        </p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/1ynden/RecipeBuddy" target="void(0)">Recipe Buddy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div class="off"> Fall '21</div></h3>
        <p>
          A semester-long full-stack development project whose purpose is to emulate a recipe-sharing website for a number of users. Utilizing jQuery for the front-end and PHP to access the MySQL database, users are able to navigate the site in order to register accounts and log in, as well as to create and browse recipes.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/1ynden/Cryptune" target="void(0)">Cryptune</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div class="off"> Fall '21</div></h3>
        <p>
          A little passion project which encodes messages as a series of tonal sounds, similarly to Morse code. The program is written in Python3, and generates tones of varying types by translating a series of points into a WAVE format. Once the tones of a certain message have been encoded and made playable, the program plays them aloud.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://1ynden.github.io/Media-Gallery" target="void(0)">Media Gallery</a>,

        <p>
          Exploratory project sites in strict HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. Focused around design and composure of websites and functionalities like adaptable screen sizing and interactable elements.
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://github.com/1ynden/CS451-FinalProject-AIsnake" target="void(0)">AI Snake</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div class="off"> Spring '21</div></h3>
        <p>
          A game of Snake written in Python which plays on its own with relative proficiency using A* pathfinding and other AI algorithms. Uses PyGame to broadcast its progress to a display window as it operates.
        </p>
        <h3>Human Image Detector&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <div class="off"> Spring '21</div></h3>
        <p>
          A MATLAB project in which an agent is trained using images containing a person versus images sans people by extracting HOG features from the images to recognize the general shape of a human. The agent, once trained, can identify people in a new image and draw a bounding box around each one.
